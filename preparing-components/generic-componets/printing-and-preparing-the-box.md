# Printing and preparing the box

#### Time required

* **Preparation:** 30 Minutes
* **Print Time:** approx. 15 hours 
* **Curing time after Aceton:** 1 day 

#### Tools required

* 3D-Printer \(Prusa recommendet\)

#### Parts required

* ASA Filament
* Acton 

## The right printing material

We choose ASA \(Extrudr ASA\) as our printing material of choice:

* **Light** \(approx. 30% lighter than PETG\)
* **Stable** - good layer adhesion \(compared to ABS\)
* Can be smoothed with **Aceton**

## Settings for the slicing / printing

Seams are very important, when printing watertight elements: by default, most slicers set the seams next to each other, because this looks better. But this leads also to an easy way for water to penetrate all the perimeters. Set to "Random"

The brim is important, when printing with ASA. ASA tends to warp and contract - this holds the print better to the plate.

Density is set to 100% - the box is designed, to print in 4+ perimeters, this makes sure, all the cavities are filled.
