## Settings for the slicing / printing

Seams are very important, when printing watertight elements: by default, most slicers set the seams next to each other, because this looks better. But this leads also to an easy way for water to penetrate all the perimeters. Set to "Random"

The brim is important, when printing with ASA. ASA tends to warp and contract - this holds the print better to the plate.

Density is set to 100% - the box is designed, to print in 4+ perimeters, this makes sure, all the cavities are filled.
