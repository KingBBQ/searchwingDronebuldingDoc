## Preparing the wings

### Preparing and installing the servo pushrods

### Install the carbon

Put glue on the carbon rod and the corresponding place in the vtail. Wait 10 minutes and push the rod into the corresponding place.

### Installing the rudder horn

Put glue on the lower part of the ruder horn. Put glue on the wing part.

Insert the ruder horn into the wing and apply pressure:

### Installing the servos into the wings

Make sure the servo is centered before installing the servo into the wing. Make sure the servo arm is installed with a O-Ring inbetween the servo arm and the servo housing.

#### Installing the servos in the main wings

![Center the ailerons - then attach the rudder horn on the servo](../../.gitbook/assets/wing-main-1.jpg)

![Only then attach and tighten the screw](../../.gitbook/assets/wing-main-2.jpg)

![Add silicon at the cable connection to the servo - this part can be problematic otherwise](../../.gitbook/assets/wing-main-4.jpg)

![Also fix the cables with silicon](../../.gitbook/assets/wing-main-6.jpg)



#### V-Tails
