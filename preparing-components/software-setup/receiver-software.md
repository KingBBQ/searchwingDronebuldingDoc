# Receiver Software

## Update Firmware on the reciever R-XSR

The used receiver [FrSky R-XSR](../../parts/list-of-parts-and-where-to-buy.md#receiver) might need a firmware update: if the receiver doesn't bind to the remote control, the firmware of the receiver and RC might be not compatible.

To flash the receiver you need:

* Taranis 9D+
* R-XSR

  * included connection cable

 

### Modify the connection cable 

On the included jumper cable, you have to swap the red \(5V\) and black cable \(GND\) as in the picture.
